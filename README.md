# Shipping and Using a WebAssembly NPM Package

This is the mini demo code for my (to be written) blog post
on shipping and usign WebAssembly in an NPM package.
The Wasm package can be found [here on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@twinklebear/wasm_demo_package).
It's based on my C++ WebGPU -> Wasm/Native
template, check that out for the latest updates and to get
started with WebGPU: https://github.com/Twinklebear/webgpu-cpp-wasm .
Also see my [blog post on building, shipping and debugging
a WebAssembly app](https://www.willusher.io/blog/build-ship-debug-wasm/)
which this code extends.
